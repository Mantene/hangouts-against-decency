"Cards Against Humanity"-like game for Google Plus Hangouts 
Lovingly forked from https://github.com/samurailink3/hangouts-against-humanity

Interface Changes include using a different CSS file, removing the video window, trying to better deal with new players and players who have left, change main panel title to show who the Card Czar is at any moment, add an actual reset button to the interface. More changes to follow.
